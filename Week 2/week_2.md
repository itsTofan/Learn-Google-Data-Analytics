# Embrace Your Data Analyst Skills

## Key Data Analyst Skills
> You might not realize it yet, but you've already got analytical skills, and it's important to acknowledge and embrace them, especially as they'll be your allies as a data analyst. Let's prove this to you – I'll break down five key components of analytical skills.
>
> **1. Curiosity**: Curiosity is about having that itch to learn and explore new things. If you're here with me right now, you've already shown that you've got curiosity. Easy, right?
>
> **2. Understanding Context**: Context is where something happens or exists. Think of it like counting to 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. All of these numbers fit in the context of counting. Now, if someone said 1, 2, 4, 5, 3, that "3" is out of context. Paying attention to the bigger picture helps you grasp context – just like you do when organizing your grocery list or spotting a joker in a deck of cards.
>
> **3. Technical Mindset**: A technical mindset means breaking things down into steps and working through them logically. Picture paying bills – you sort them by due date, compare the total with your account balance, and then pay them. This is your technical mindset at work, turning a complex task into manageable steps.
>
> **4. Data Design**: Data design is how you organize information. It's like arranging your phone contacts by first name or using email addresses instead of names. You're creating a structured system to make communication smoother and quicker.
>
> **5. Data Strategy**: Data strategy involves managing the people, processes, and tools in data analysis. You ensure that people know how to use data, create clear paths to solutions, and employ suitable technology. Let's make this practical: imagine mowing a lawn. Step 1 is reading the mower manual (people), step 2 is clearing the lawn of obstacles (process), and step 3 is checking your mower (tool) for gas and oil to mow safely.
>
> So, to recap, the five essential skills are curiosity, understanding context, a technical mindset, data design, and data strategy. See? You're already an analytical thinker. Now, go ahead and put these skills into action as you continue through this course. If you're curious about what's next, keep moving to the next video.  


# Thinking about analytical thinking

## All about thinking analytically
> Now that you're aware of the five essential skills of a data analyst, let's dive deeper into what it really means to think analytically. Thinking is an innate process, but there are various modes of thinking – creative, critical, abstract, and more. Let's focus on analytical thinking.
> 
> Analytical thinking involves recognizing problems, defining them, and methodically solving them using data. So, how do data analysts apply analytical thinking? Well, let's explore the second set of five – the five key aspects of analytical thinking:
> 
> **1. Visualization**: In data analytics, visualization refers to presenting information graphically, like through graphs and maps. Visuals help analysts comprehend and communicate data more effectively. Just think about explaining the Grand Canyon – a picture would be much more impactful than words alone.
> 
> **2. Strategy**: In the era of data abundance, strategic thinking is crucial. It keeps analysts focused on goals, helping them achieve what they want from the data. By strategizing, data quality improves, ensuring that collected data is always valuable.
> 
> **3. Problem-Orientation**: This approach centers around identifying, defining, and solving problems. Throughout a project, data analysts stay aligned with the core problem. For instance, imagine a warehouse constantly facing supply shortages. Solving this issue remains the top priority, guiding all strategies and decisions.
> 
> **4. Correlation**: Analytical thinkers can identify correlations – relationships – between data points. While correlations are abundant, remember that correlation doesn't imply causation. Just because two things move in the same direction doesn't mean one causes the other.
> 
> **5. Big-Picture and Detail-Oriented Thinking**: This dual approach involves seeing both the overall perspective and the fine details. It's like viewing a jigsaw puzzle – appreciating the complete picture while understanding the significance of each piece. Big-picture thinking fuels innovation, while detail-oriented thinking ensures effective execution.
> 
> These aspects collectively shape your analytical thinking skills. They empower you to make informed decisions and derive meaningful insights from data. As you progress through this course, you'll learn how to effectively employ these aspects when working with data. So, get ready to embrace your analytical mindset and unleash its power.

## Exploring core analytical skills
> The five key aspects – visualization, strategy, problem-orientation, correlation, and big-picture and detail-oriented thinking – are fundamental to analytical thinking. While individuals may naturally lean towards certain thinking styles, developing a versatile mindset is crucial for effective data analysis. Embracing different ways of thinking allows you to think creatively, critically, and analytically, enabling you to approach problems from various angles and generate innovative solutions.
> 
> In the realm of data analysis, solutions are rarely straightforward. Critical thinking helps you formulate the right questions to ask, while creative thinking generates unexpected answers. Let's delve into some of the common questions that data analysts use in their pursuit of solutions:
> 
> **1. What is the root cause of a problem?**: Identifying the root cause helps prevent recurring issues. The "Five Whys" technique involves asking "why" five times to reveal the underlying cause. Each "why" delves deeper into the issue, ultimately leading to the root cause. This technique uncovers insightful and sometimes surprising insights.
> 
> **2. Where are the gaps in our process?**: Gap analysis involves assessing the current state of a process and comparing it to the desired future state. By identifying gaps between the two, organizations can strategize how to bridge those gaps and improve efficiency.
> 
> **3. What did we not consider before?**: This question prompts reflection on overlooked information or procedures that might enhance decision-making and strategies. Considering unexplored aspects can lead to better outcomes.
> 
> As you embark on your data analytics journey, you'll likely formulate many more insightful questions. The way data analysts think and inquire plays a pivotal role in shaping business decisions. Analytical thinking, coupled with the ability to ask the right questions, significantly impacts a company's overall success. Later, we'll explore how data-driven decisions contribute to achieving positive outcomes.
